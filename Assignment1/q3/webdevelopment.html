    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>In a few words, web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites. By “website,” we mean a collection of web pages that are publicly accessible on the internet, such as:

        The Codecademy website
        A closed, private network, such as your company or school intranet website.
        Modern web development also includes web applications. Web applications are software packages that run on a web server and are accessed through the internet. This is unlike a traditional application that runs on your computer, tablet, or phone.</p>
